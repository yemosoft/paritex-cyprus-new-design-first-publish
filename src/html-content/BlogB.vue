    <p>The terms "bull" and "bear" or "bullish" and "bearish" are what crypto owners use to escribe big market changes, but
        what does each term actually mean? Today, we'll run through what kind of fluctuations these words refer to.
    </p>
    <p>Though "bull" and "bear" are now commonly used in the crypto world, they did not originate there. In fact, these
        terms
        were first used in the traditional stock market. It is thought that these two words were chosen because of the way
        bulls
        and bears fight. While bulls steer their horns upwards, bears point their heads downwards in combat.</p>
